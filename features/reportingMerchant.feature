Feature: Create a report with merchant transactions

  # A reporting interface generates for a merchant the list of his transactions (amount of money transfered and token used) in a time period.
  # This forms the bases of a monthly statatus report sent to the customer.
  # To model a semi-anonymous payment system, the merchant should not know who the customer was.
